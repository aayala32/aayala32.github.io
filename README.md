Hi, I'm Andrea Ayala. Welcome to my page! 

### About ME

I study at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, currently majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I plan on minoring in Business as soon as I get all of my prerequisites complete. I am experienced in programming in Java. During my free time, I find myself with  friends, putting together 2000 piece jigsaw puzzles, and coding just for the fun of it. Side note: This page is new so I do hope to add some of my work and things that will help you get to know what I'm capable of.
